  "description": "Ocean is defined as the mass of water occupying all of the Earth's surface not occupied by land, but excluding all lakes and inland seas. Covering some 70% of the Earthss surface, the ocean is a major driver of the world's weather and climate. It also plays a central role in climate change. The ocean is also a major driver of the global economy, carrying more than 90% of world trade and sustaining the 40% of humanity that lives within 100 km of the coast. Today, the growing impacts of climate change are making ocean observations, research and services more critical than ever before (source: https://www.eionet.europa.eu/gemet/en/concept/5789; https://public.wmo.int/en/our-mandate/focus-areas/oceans).
